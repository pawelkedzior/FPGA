  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

Total REAL time to MAP completion:  8 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   8 secs 

NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity - e.g. two
   LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.  When assembling slices,
   Map gives priority to combine logic that is related.  Doing so results in
   the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin packing
   unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are occupied through
   related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through related
   logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely utilized.
   Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until all usable LUTs
   and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing budget, increased levels of
   unrelated logic packing may adversely affect the overall timing performance
   of your design.

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:Pack:249 - The following adjacent carry multiplexers occupy different
   slice components.  The resulting carry chain will have suboptimal timing.
   	Mcompar_leway_cmp_le0000_cy<10>
   	Maddsub_leway_mux0000_cy<0>
WARNING:Pack:266 - The function generator Mrom__rom000144 failed to merge with
   F5 multiplexer Mrom__rom000159_f6/MUXF5.I1.  There is a conflict for the
   GYMUX.  The design will exhibit suboptimal timing.
WARNING:Pack:266 - The function generator Mrom__rom000144 failed to merge with
   F5 multiplexer Mrom__rom000144_f6/MUXF5.I1.  There is a conflict for the
   GYMUX.  The design will exhibit suboptimal timing.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net wlaczony_not0001 is sourced
   by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to
   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
